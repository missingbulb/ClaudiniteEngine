# The local Phase 1 gate, against the built release in $DIST (default
# dist/) served by regstub, in three modes of the launcher's pin move:
#
#   fresh    the host's smoke leg (release/smoke-platform.sh) on a new member
#   current  a member warm on this release moves its pin to the next ordinal
#            (rebuilt from the same source into dist2/): SessionStart fetches
#            it and the old version's cache stays untouched
#   stale    a member warm on this release moves its pin to a version the
#            registry does not serve: SessionStart halts, and the guards
#            still run the verified engine linked before
#
#   release/rehearse.sh [--mode fresh|current|stale]   (default: all three)
#
# Needs go, node, curl and a release from release/build.sh.
